I already have an existing HTML, CSS, and JS landing page template designed for my brand CAABAA, a futuristic car modification and accessories company. The theme and design system are already created — I just need to add and modify some sections according to the following layout and structure. Please use a futuristic, neon-inspired, tech-forward style that fits the brand theme (think sleek UI, glassmorphism, glowing effects, and smooth animations).

Here’s what I want to include or modify:

1. Header Section:

Keep existing styling, just ensure it includes navigation links to all new sections:

Home, About, Modifications, Accessories, Insurance, Why CAABAA, Contact

Include the CAABAA logo (already available) on the left.

On the right: “Login” and “Signup” buttons with hover glow effects.

2. Hero Section:

Replace current hero background with an AI-generated futuristic car video background.

Add overlay gradient or neon effects for readability.

Include a bold heading, subtext, and a CTA button (“Explore Modifications”).

3. Three Alternating Image & Text Sections:

Section 1: Image on left, text on right.

Section 2: Image on right, text on left.

Section 3: Image on left, text on right.

Add an animated futuristic car that scrolls or transitions visually across these three sections (like a smooth driving animation).

Use AI-generated placeholder images that look high-tech and match car modification themes.

4. Trending Modifications Section:

Carousel with 3 slides showcasing trending car modifications.

Each slide should have an image, title, and brief description.

Generate AI placeholder images with a futuristic look for each.

5. Trending Accessories Carousel:

Carousel with 4 slides displaying trending accessories.

Each slide should feature an AI-generated image, product name, and short caption.

6. New Launches Section:

Another carousel with 4 slides featuring new accessory launches.

Use similar layout but with “New Launch” tags or effects.

7. Car Insurance Section:

Carousel with 3 slides showing different insurance offers or plans.

Add a CTA button (“Get Your Quote”) on the last slide.

8. “Why CAABAA” Section:

Split layout:

Left: Large “Why CAABAA” heading with subtle glow effect.

Right: List of 4–6 key selling points, each prefixed by an arrow or futuristic icon.

9. CTA Section (Conversion Section):

Left side: motivational text (“Upgrade Your Ride Today”).

Right side: prominent CTA button (“Start Modifying”).

Add glowing animation on button hover.

10. Footer:

Include:

CAABAA logo (small version).

Short brand description.

Social media icons (glow or hover effects).

Quick links (Home, About, Contact, etc.).

Newsletter subscription box with glowing input border.

Notes:

The theme is already created, just modify the existing template to include these new sections.

Maintain responsiveness and use existing color palette and style.

Use subtle futuristic animations and transitions (e.g., car motion, hover glow, parallax scrolling).

Generate AI placeholder images for all new content areas (use realistic, modern car and tech themes).

Deliver the final structure in HTML, CSS, and JS integrated with the existing codebase.
